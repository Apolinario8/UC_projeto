# Development of methane mitigation strategies using the microalga Chlorella vulgaris
The objective of this project is two fold. Firstly, develop a genome-scale metabolic model for Chlorella vulgaris using merlin. Secondly, utilize this model to conduct in silico simulations and optimizations aiming at modelling the CH4 metabolization by the microalga.
